Is Puerto Vallarta Safe?
 That is what people want to know.
If you ask a local if Puerto Vallarta is safe, you will probably be met with a laugh.
Mexico has many problems with safety and parts of the country are worse than others but Mexico is a big place. Puerto Vallarta has remained nearly immune thanks to local, state, and federal authorities making sure that tourists in our area remain safe.With Billions of dollars allocated to future development in the region, tourism is at the top of the agenda as it is the biggest employer and generates millions for the economy.

Even in other parts of Mexico with high crime and violence, tourists are rarely the victims (of violence). Take away cartel on cartel violence and Mexico becomes much safer than the United States. A foreign tourist is more likely to become the victim of a violent crime in the U.S., and your chances are slim-to-none if you are not involved in the drug trade while visiting Mexico.
There are victims of crime just like other parts of the world, but far and few between involving tourists.Sometimes tourists leave their commonsense at the airport before departure.It is not recommended to flash money around, we recommend keeping your wallet in your front pocket, women should have purses that can go over the shoulder (if you must carry one), keep purses zipped up, not hanging open. Donâ€™t leave valuables unattended on the beach, this is just common-sense. 
Comparing Puerto Vallarta to many popular tourist destinations in the U.S Per capita, you are more likely to be a victim of violent crime in Orlando, Washington D.C., Hollywood, Los Angeles, Chicago, New York City, and other well-known tourist spots than in Mexico.
If you go looking for trouble you will find it anywhere in the world,
Stay safe !
