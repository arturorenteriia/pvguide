Accessible by boat, this handsome, quarter-mile-long beach slopes gently down to the water. Most day visitors (there are some hotels nearby) divide their time between playing on the sand and taking a jungle hike to the Cascada Cola del Caballo (Horse Tail Waterfall), which has a small pool to swim in at its base.

 This charming fishing village, just a 10-kilometer (6-mi) drive from Puerto Vallarta, draws beachgoers with its calm, swimmable waters, relative quiet (for true peace you'll need to go somewhere a bit more remote), and friendly taco stands and watersports-rental shacks. Regular public bus service between PV and the town is available.</p>

                  <p class="text-justify"> 
Beloved by surfers, this groovy little town has the beach at its heart, and lots of cute restaurants, bars, and shops line the streets that dead-end at the ocean. The shore break is the perfect spot for beginning surfers to stand up for the first time. A left point break in the bay offers up more challenging waves. Sayulita is a pleasant, 40-kilometer (25-mi) drive from Puerto Vallarta.</p>

No longer the pristine and deserted cove portrayed in the 1964 movie The Night of the Iguana, Mismaloya still has its charms, including good snorkeling and lots of services. The latter include massage therapists who stroll the beach looking for customers, fish shacks serving up meals plucked fresh from the sea, kayak rentals, and more. The beach is about 13 kilometers (8 mi) from Puerto Vallarta and accessible by public busâ€”though you'll have to walk a dirt road from the bus stop to the sand.</p>
