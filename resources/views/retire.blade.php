The yearly index is designed to help whittle down a retiree’s choices by ranking countries based on factors such as cost of living, retiree benefits, climate, crime and health care.
With its low costs and friendly locals, Mexico is no stranger to the index, consistently ranking in the top 10 over the past 14 years. And in 2017 — for the fifth time — it nabs the top spot.
