               </h3>
               <div>





<p class="text-justify">Uber started operations in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, on June 27 2017 . Uber connects passengers to drivers with a hire service that connects  through a smartphone app that uses GPS technology to track both the user and the driver.

<b>How does Uber work?</b>

<p class="text-justify">The passenger calls for a car using the Uber app, ( for those not up to date with technology, you can go on the internet and find uber )Then the nearest available Uber driver is called to the passengerâ€™s location, taking the passenger to their destination. 
The app will give you  a price estimate for your journey, then you can pay in cash, credit card or debit card.

                     <div class="gal-detail thumb box-shadow">
                        <img src="images/uber2.jpeg" class="thumb-img" alt="work-thumbnail">
                        </a></div>
                        <br>
                     <br>
                  </div>
                  
<p class="text-justify">Uber has the lowest fees applicable for any journey, sometimes fifty percent cheaper than a regular taxi. Drivers have to maintain their vehicles which have to be no less than a couple of years old and provide some extra service like a water bottle or newspaper. 
</p>


<p class="text-justify">The convenience is evident when you realize that you can actually see where your transport  is and how long before it gets to you. Efficiency is the name of the game when the nearest Uber car gets to you in record time. From personal experience, I have never waited more than 4 or 5 minutes before the car arrives. 
Ubers introduction to Puerto Vallarta will be a game changer breaking the taxi operators monopoly which allows for old unsafe vehicles , overcharging, poor regulation and drivers who have been known to take advantage of unsuspecting tourists who do not know the U.S or Canadian Dollar exchange rate to the Mexican Peso. Currently service is limited due to the low volume of cars, but we can see this becoming an overwhelming option used by tourists in the future. If you want to start using Uber in Puerto Vallarta...
